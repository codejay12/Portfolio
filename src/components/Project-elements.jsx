Fake news is sometimes transmitted through the internet by some unauthorised sources, which creates issues for the targeted person and it makes them panic and leads to even violence.",link:"https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fake-News-Detection.jpg"},

  {id:2,title:" Detecting Forest Fire",descp:"Developing a project for identifying the forest fire and wildfire system is an alternatively good example to exhibit one’s skills in Data Science. The forest fire or wildfire is an uncontrollable fire that develops in a forest. All the  forest fir will create havoc during weekends on the animal habitat, surrounding environment and human property. k-means clustering can be used for the identification of the  crucial hotspots during forest fire  and to reduce the  severity , to regulate them and even  to predict the behaviour of the wildfire.",link:"https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Forest-Fire.jpg"},

    id:3,title:" Detection of Road Lane Lines",descp:"A Live Lane-Line Detection Systems built-in Python language is another Data Science project idea for beginners. A human driver receives lane detecting instruction from lines placed on the road in this project. The lines placed on the roads indicate where the lanes are located for human driving. It also refers to the vehicle’s steering direction.",link:"https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Detection-of-Road-Lane-Lines-.jpg"
